## Targeting drawing technique: Raindrop effect

**Examples** 
*Two examples are used to illustrate the raindrop effect.* 

#### Example list
1. The Matrix
2. The Silent Hill

#### Why these examples are chosen
-These two films are both very famous and successful.
-In the matrix example, the raindrops on the window not only look aesthetic, but also enhances the moody atmosphere in that scene.
-In the silent hill example, the raindrops increase the sense of immersion. Also, they made a distinguish between the raindrops on shoulder, in the background, and on the screen.
