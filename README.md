## Targeting drawing technique: Raindrop effect

#### Why raindrop effect is beneficial to final project
>I'm targeting the'Saint Georges majeur au crepuscule' by Claude Monet as the final project. Since this artwork pictures a colorful lake and it looks like rain falls on the lake, drawing raindrops will make the final project look more real and immersive. Here is a picture of the artwork.

**Examples** 
*Two examples are used to illustrate the raindrop effect.* 

#### Example list
1. The Matrix
2. The Silent Hill

#### Why these examples are chosen
-These two films are both very famous and successful.
-In the matrix example, the raindrops on the window not only look aesthetic, but also enhances the moody atmosphere in that scene.
-In the silent hill example, the raindrops increase the sense of immersion. Also, they made a distinguish between the raindrops on shoulder, in the background, and on the screen.

#### Wikipedia links to these two films

## Exploring Coding Technique

#### Drawing waterdrops using WebGL by Lucas Bebber
>I found an example code on Github. Here is the link to this repository. 
[A link to example code](https://github.com/codrops/RainEffect.git) 
And here is a demo they made using this technique. In the demo, you can see that the raindrops look incredibly real.

#### Using noise() 
>When the falling speed is fast, the whole background will look blurred.This noise function can be used to randomize the tracks of raindrops falling. 

```
noise();
```
